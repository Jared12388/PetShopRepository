# Pet Shop Repository: 
Pet Shop Purposes
The Pet Shop System is designed to streamline operations and improve customer satisfaction for pet-related businesses. This platform integrates robust inventory management, simplified ordering processes, and appointment scheduling, all through an intuitive user interface. The website caters to both customers and store administrators by offering functionalities such as detailed product listings, filters for tailored searches, real-time booking for services, and comprehensive review systems to enhance transparency and trust.

# Project Description:
This website acts as a one-stop solution for pet owners and shop managers alike. Customers can browse through a variety of pet-related products, place orders, book grooming or veterinary appointments, and leave product reviews. Meanwhile, administrators can efficiently manage inventory, view orders, and maintain the catalog through a user-friendly dashboard.

# Setup Guide:
To set up the Pet Shop System, start by creating a virtual environment to isolate project dependencies.

On Windows, use the command py -m venv myenv and activate it with myenv\Scripts\activate.

For macOS or Linux users, create the virtual environment with python3 -m venv myenv and activate it using source myenv/bin/activate. 

Once the virtual environment is active, install Django by running pip install django.

Next, navigate to the project directory by using the command cd account.

Install any additional dependencies required for the project, such as Pillow, which is essential for handling image uploads. 

You can install Pillow with the command python -m pip install Pillow. 

Finally, start the development server by running python manage.py runserver. 

Once the server is running, open your web browser and go to http://127.0.0.1:8000 to access the Pet Shop System. 

This setup will prepare the application for testing and development.
